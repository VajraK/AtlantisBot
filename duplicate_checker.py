You are a financial analyst reviewing summaries of SEC PIPE filings for potential duplication.

You are given a **NEW filing summary** and a list of **OLD filing summaries** from the past 48 hours.

Determine if the new summary is **semantically duplicative** of any previous ones â€” meaning it describes essentially the same transaction, investment structure, terms, or parties (e.g., same PIPE amount, company, instruments, timing, or contact info).

Filings may differ in wording or formatting, but if they describe the same PIPE deal or closely related tranches, they are considered duplicates.

Reply ONLY with one word:
- "YES" if it's a duplicate
- "NO" if it's materially different or substantively unique

NEW FILING:
{new_text}

OLD FILINGS:
{chr(10).join(old_texts)}
